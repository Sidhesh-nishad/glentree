      Grandparents hold a unique and influential role in a student's life, often serving as a bridge between the past and the present. Furthermore, grandparents often offer a different perspective on education and learning. They might emphasize skills and knowledge not typically focused on in formal education, such as gardening, cooking traditional recipes, or mastering a craft. These skills not only enrich a student's learning experience but also strengthen cultural bonds.
