            It’s hard to deal with your child’s tantrums while studying or doing any other chores. Studies have proven that students who play sports or who are involved in physical or fitness activities have increased levels of concentration and focus.

            Times have definitely changed and that holds good for our food habits too. Children often get addicted to flashy junk foods, canned and processed foods, sodas and carbonated drinks. These foods are termed “unhealthy” and ultimately leads to child obesity. We all do understand the many health problems that are associated with the consumption of these unhealthy foods. Hence only with regular exercise implemented from childhood, a child will turn out to be a healthy individual.

            Depression and anxiety have become two extremely common words for Gen-Z kids. These words have lost their original meaning and have turned as mere tags to brand kids. As parents, we often forget to understand that depression and anxiety come in many forms. One way to ensure that kids don’t fall into these traps is to ensure that they step away from their homes and step their foot in nature and perform some fitness activities. Every child needs to be physically active to keep their mental health on track.

            In order to be a leader, you must be a good team player. Only if an individual is able to cooperate and be a part of a great team, he or she will automatically be a great leader of a team. One way to instil these qualities of teamwork and leadership is to encourage children to participate in sports. It helps young people to improve their leadership skills and teaches them how to be spirited as a team or a community. Through physical exercises, students learn how to make and break bonds between their peers and this creates a healthy dynamic between the children. With teamplay, kids are more concerned not only about themselves but also their fellow mates and this brings about a community spirit amongst them. With values like these being sown into them at a very young age, they are sure to turn out to be great citizens of the country.

            Body-shaming and defaming based on physical appearance is at its highest now. People have turned intolerant towards each other and pass harsh comments by making others feel insecure. It is highly important for everyone who promotes body image to promote physical activities as it is the only way through which an individual can look happy, feel good and right about themselves and their body. Especially women and girls have been constantly for their looks and appearance. Hence with this societal pressure to look in a specified way, physical activities are of utmost importance.
